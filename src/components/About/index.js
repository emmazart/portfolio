            I'm a full stack web developer leveraging my theatre management and small
            business operations background to build helpful and intuitive tools for
            everyday use. 
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            I recently completed a certificate in full stack development
            from the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp, am known as a leader in group-developed projects,
            and have a passion for streamlining communication and developing clean, user-friendly
            applications. 
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">        
            In personal projects, my goal is to learn new technologies
            and use current knowledge in novel ways, not always focusing on the end
            product as the driving force. Iâ€™m looking for my next opportunity and excited to join a collaborative,
            quality and community-driven team to build applications with a purpose.
