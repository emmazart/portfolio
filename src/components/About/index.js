      <h3>Hi! I'm Emma</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a full stack web developer leveraging my theatre management and small
        business operations background to build helpful and intuitive tools for
        everyday use. <br className="py-3" /> I recently completed a certificate in full stack development
        from the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp, am known as a leader in group-developed projects,
        and have a passion for streamlining communication and developing clean, user-friendly
        applications. <br className="py-3"/> In personal projects, my goal is to learn new technologies
        and use current knowledge in novel ways, not always focusing on the end
        product as the driving force. Iâ€™m looking for my next opportunity and excited to join a collaborative,
        quality and community-driven team to build applications with a purpose.
